1.1 – App background:
This application will be called ‘Mirror.’ It is an application designed for people to:
• Assist those who struggle with having a direction in their life
• Be more consistent and being congruent with who they want to be in future.
• Help achieve improved focus and achieve great results in their life
• Hold themselves accountable every day.
• Build discipline, consistency and close the gap to their old self and higher self
• Achieve freedom of control over their ‘currencies’ - money, time and energy
• ‘Hold up a mirror’ to themselves – clear view of their lifestyle and whether it is benefitting them or not, through their actions.
