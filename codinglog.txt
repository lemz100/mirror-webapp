-Prepared the environment by using my own custom React and Node.JS Template bundled with Webpack, Prettier and ESLint
- Fixed up LESS Modules issues by setting the option 'esModule' to false in the webpack.config.js file
    -Expected .module.less to be a ES6 file, however from setting this it now expects .module.less to be a CommonJS File.
